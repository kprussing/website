  abstract: It is well known that the radiative transport between particles, particularly
    the case of nano-sized particles, can exceed the black body limit when the separation
    between the particles less than the thermal wavelength λ\_T∼hc\\/(k\_B T). This
    energy exchange can drastically affect the temperature profile of a system. The
    ability to influence the temperature profile of a system has applications in microprocessor
    design and thermophotovoltaic cell efficiency. Recent work has shown that the
    temperature dependence of a system of dipoles is influenced by the configuration.
    Other work has demonstrated a methodology to investigate the total flux into closely
    separated bodies using the boundary element method. This computational method
    permits the insertion of test surfaces into the two-body system to readily assess
    the directionality of the electromagnetic flux at additional points in space.
    By studying the effect of particle shape and orientation of the flux through such
    a test surface, it will be possible to establish geometric configurations to directionally
    channel the electromagnetic flux through a system of particles. In this poster,
    we outline the methodology to compute the flux distribution and consider the flux
    in the initial case between a sphere and a spheroid as a function of eccentricity.

  title: Imaging FTIR Emissivity Measurement Method
  page: 88700B-88700B-7
  volume: '8870'
  source: Silverchair
  note: Performed data reduction and analysis.
  abstract: Though many materials behave approximately as greybodies across the long-wave
    infrared (LWIR) waveband, certain important infrared (IR) scene modeling materials
    such as brick and galvanized steel exhibit more complex optical properties1. Accurately
    describing how non-greybody materials interact relies critically on the accurate
    incorporation of the emissive and reflective properties of the in-scene materials.
    Typically, measured values are obtained and used. When measured using a non-imaging
    spectrometer, a given material’s spectral emissivity requires more than one collection
    episode, as both the sample under test and a standard must be measured separately.
    In the interval between episodes changes in environment degrade emissivity measurement
    accuracy. While repeating and averaging measurements of the standard and sample
    helps mitigate such effects, a simultaneous measurement of both can ensure identical
    environmental conditions during the measurement process, thus reducing inaccuracies
    and delivering a temporally accurate determination of background or ‘down-welling’
    radiation. We report on a method for minimizing temporal inaccuracies in sample
    emissivity measurements. Using a LWIR hyperspectral imager, a Telops Hyper-Cam2,
    an approach permitting hundreds of simultaneous, calibrated spectral radiance
    measurements of the sample under test as well as a diffuse gold standard is described.
    In addition, we describe the data reduction technique to exploit these measurements.
    Following development of the reported method, spectral reflectance data from 10
    samples of various materials of interest were collected. These data are presented
    along with comments on how such data will enhance the fidelity of computer models
    of IR scenes.

  abstract: Georgia Tech has investigated methods for the detection and tracking of
    personnel in a variety of acquisition environments. This research effort focused
    on a detailed phenomenological analysis of human physiology and signatures with
    the subsequent identification and characterization of potential observables. Both
    aspects are needed to support the development of personnel detection and tracking
    algorithms. As a fundamental part of this research effort, Georgia Tech collected
    motion capture data on an individual for a variety of walking speeds, carrying
    loads, and load distributions. These data formed the basis for deriving fundamental
    properties of the individual’s motion and the derivation of motionbased observables,
    and changes in these fundamental properties arising from load variations. Analyses
    were conducted to characterize the motion properties of various body components
    such as leg swing, arm swing, head motion, and full body motion. This paper will
    describe the data acquisition process, extraction of motion characteristics, and
    analysis of these data. Video sequences illustrating the motion data and analysis
    results will also be presented.

  abstract: A core component to modeling visible and infrared sensor responses is
    the ability to faithfully recreate background noise and clutter in a synthetic
    image. Most tracking and detection algorithms use a combination of signal to noise
    or clutter to noise ratios to determine if a signature is of interest. A primary
    source of clutter is the background that defines the environment in which a target
    is placed. Over the past few years, the Electro-Optical Systems Laboratory (EOSL)
    at the Georgia Tech Research Institute has made significant improvements to its
    in house simulation framework GTSIMS. First, we have expanded our terrain models
    to include the effects of terrain orientation on emission and reflection. Second,
    we have included the ability to model dynamic reflections with full BRDF support.
    Third, we have added the ability to render physically accurate cirrus clouds.
    And finally, we have updated the overall rendering procedure to reduce the time
    necessary to generate a single frame by taking advantage of hardware acceleration.
    Here, we present the updates to GTSIMS to better predict clutter and noise doe
    to non-uniform backgrounds. Specifically, we show how the addition of clouds,
    terrain, and improved non-uniform sky rendering improve our ability to represent
    clutter during scene generation.

  volume: '10986'
  abstract: 'A key component of a night scene background on a clear moonless night
    is the stellar background. Celestial objects affected by atmospheric distortions
    and optical system noise become the primary contribution of clutter for detection
    and tracking algorithms while at the same time providing a solid geolocation or
    time reference due to their highly predictable motion. Any detection algorithm
    that needs to operate on a clear night must take into account the stellar background
    and remove it via background subtraction methods. As with any scenario, the ability
    to develop detection algorithms depends on the availability of representative
    data to evaluate the difficulty of the task. Further, the acquisition of measured
    field data under arbitrary atmospheric conditions is difficult if not impossible.
    For this reason, a radiometrically accurate simulation of the stellar background
    is a boon to algorithm developers. To aid in simulating the night sky, we have
    incorporated a star-field rendering model into the Georgia Tech Simulations Integrated
    Modeling System (GTSIMS). Rendering a radiometrically accurate star-field requires
    three major components: positioning the stars as a function of time and observer
    location, determining the in-band radiance of each star, and simulating the apparent
    size of each star. We present the models we have incorporated into GTSIMS and
    provide a representative sample of the images generated with the new model. We
    then demonstrate how the clutter in the neighborhood of a pixels change by including
    a radiometrically accurate rendering of a star-field.'
