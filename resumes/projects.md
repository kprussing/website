### Open source projects

#### Personal projects

Most of my personal repositories are on [GitHub], but I also have a few

    Docstrip files.
-   [scons-inkscape][]: A [SCons][] Tool for converting images using
    [Inkscape][].
-   [scons-pandoc][]: A [SCons][] Tool for working with [Pandoc][].
-   [vitables_console][]: A plugin for [ViTables][] to launch a Jupyter
    QtConsole for scripted interaction with open files.
-   [vtimshow][]: A plugin for [ViTables][] to visualize datasets with
    [PyQtGraph][].
-   [zenburn-latex][]: Translation of the Zenburn color scheme for Vim
    for use in LaTeX.

#### Contributor
