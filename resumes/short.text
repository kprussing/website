:   Student Research Assistant at **Georgia Tech Research Institute**, 
    _Atlanta, GA_

*   Aided in attempt to develop a framework to simulate visible
    and infrared signatures in complex environments
*   Developed a rudimentary vehicle dynamics model for incorporation
    into complex urban environment simulations
*   Implemented a finite difference algorithm to solve Fourier's
    heat equation
*   Connected finite difference method to MySQL database to extract
    simulation parameters for complex scenes
*   Investigated lattice Boltzmann method as a means to couple
    radiative and conductive energy transport
