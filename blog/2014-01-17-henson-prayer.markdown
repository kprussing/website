| Our creator, who art in heaven,
| Muppets be thy name,
| Thy cable come, the show will be done,
| On stage, as it is on television.
| Give us this day, our daily laugh
| And give us our puppets, as we convince those who do not understand.
| And lead us not into syndicate,
| but deliver us from boredom,
| thine is the inspirational, celebrational and muppetational forever
| Ah-YAAAYY!!!!

If you **are** the Muppets, we request a cameo so that we can be someone ;-)
