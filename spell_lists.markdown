This is a collection of spell lists for Dungeons &amp Dragons 3.5
edition.  The main goal is to have all of the available spells in a
quick reference table.  This combines the spells I have from the books I
have.  The inspiration for the tables comes from a Word document I found
years ago.  I do not remember where I found it, and I can't find the
documents again (although, I haven't really spent a lot of time
looking).  The only thing I can claim credit for in the current
incarnation is the brute force work that went into creating the tables.
The tables are generated using a script I wrote and in in my [sandbox].
If you want to help make the tables, let me know or just get cracking
and send me a pull request.
