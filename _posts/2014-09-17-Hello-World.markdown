Hello, World!
=============

This is just a sample test to try to get Jekyll running.  It follows
Barry Clark's [walk
through](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/)

Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the
_config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below
:point_down:).

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into
/_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions
head over to the [Jekyll Now
repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
