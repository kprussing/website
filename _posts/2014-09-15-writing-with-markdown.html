<h1 id="writing-with-markdown">Writing with Markdown</h1>
<p>So, I have come to the realization that LaTeX is not the best way to write. By the looks of it, I am not the <a href="http://blog.martinfenner.org/2013/06/17/what-is-scholarly-markdown/">first</a> or <a href="http://recurrentprocessing.blogspot.fi/2013/02/write-academic-papers-with-markdown.html">second</a>, and I probably won't be the last. Thankfully, with the emergence of <a href="http://commonmark.org">CommonMark</a>, I can possibly make some head way. I already live in the command line, and I have grown to like the cleaner files of <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a>, so I'll try to figure this one out. This will also let me use <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">pandoc</a> to convert to PDF or Word format. However, the hold up will be getting citations in place. So, here we go!</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>The first order of business is to get things installed. I'm on OS X, so I use <a href="http://www.macports.org">MacPorts</a>. To get <code>pandoc</code> we simply call</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo port install pandoc</code></pre>
<p>According to the manual, to add a bibliography, we need <code>pandoc-citeproc</code>, but it does not appear to be in MacPorts. Rooting around on the <a href="https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-citeproc">repository</a>, it appears that this has been recently removed from <code>pandoc</code>. This would explain why it is not evident. So, we go directly to the Haskell method</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo port install haskell-platform # To get cabal
$ cabal install pandoc-citeproc</code></pre>
<p>And then simply add <code>~/.cabal/bin</code> to your <code>PATH</code>.</p>
<p>At one point, I tried to build from the cloned repository, but it failed. These were the steps if you care to try it, but I just gave up.</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-citeproc
$ cd pandoc-citeproc
$ sudo port install haskell-platform hs-cpphs # to get cabal and cpphs
$ cabal update # make fails otherwise
$ cabal install hsbhs
$ PATH=$PATH:~/.cabal/bin make
$ PREFIX=~/.local make install</code></pre>
<p>This will install to <code>~/.local/</code> for cleanliness.</p>
<h2 id="running-pandoc">Running <code>pandoc</code></h2>
<p>Now we try to make a test case</p>
<pre><code>$ cat test.text
A Title
=======

And they said stuff @narayanasway_thermal_2008.

$ cat reference.bib
@article{narayanaswamy_thermal_2008,
        title = {Thermal near-field radiative transfer between two spheres},
        volume = {77},
        url = {http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.77.075125},
        doi = {10.1103/PhysRevB.77.075125},
        number = {7},
        journal = {Physical Review B},
        author = {Narayanaswamy, Arvind and Chen, Gang},
        month = feb,
        year = {2008},
        pages = {075125},
}

$ pandoc test.text -o test.pdf --bibliography=./reference.bib --csl=physical-review-b.csl
</code></pre>
<p>And this gives us a lovely PDF!</p>
<h2 id="customizing-the-output">Customizing the Output</h2>
<p>Now, what if we want to use a specific format such a that for PRB? We could possibly use the <code>--reference-docx=FILE</code> option if the journal offers that; however, PRB does not. The <code>-H FILE</code> flag will be useful for adding in the preamble if necessary. I think we might be able to use the <code>.sty</code> file from the publisher, but that won't let us set the option. I think the ultimate answer will be to generate the <code>.latex</code> and then hand hack it to set the document class correctly.</p>
<pre><code>$ pandoc --standalone test.text -o test.latex -H preamble.tex
$ vim test.latex # Fix the document class
$ pdflatex test
$ bibtex test
$ pdflatex test
$ pdflatex test</code></pre>
<p>And now we should have a nice PDF in the desired format!</p>
<p>Now I should be able to use a nicer format to work on my articles. At the time of writing this, I have not actually used this as a work flow. I really hope this works.</p>
