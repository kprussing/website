(To be read in the voice of Kermit (or your favorite Muppet))


|                   Our creator, who art in heaven,
|                         Muppets be thy name,
|                 Thy cable come, the show will be done,
|                    On stage, as it is on television.
|                    Give us this day, our daily laugh
|   And give us our puppets, as we convince those who do not understand.
|                     And lead us not into syndicate,
|                       but deliver us from boredom,
| for thine is the inspirational, celebrational and muppetational forever
|                             Ah-YAAAYY!!!!

If you **are** the Muppets, we request a cameo so that we can be someone ;-)
