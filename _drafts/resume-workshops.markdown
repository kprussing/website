Resumes and Career Fair Prep
----------------------------

These are my notes from the seminars put on by the Career Services
department.  These will start out as pretty sporadic until I get a
chance to synthesize them.  For now, we'll start by organizing by day.

2014-08-26 Resumes and Career Fair Prep
=======================================

First, I should wait for the doors to open (i.e. the speaker is here)
before I bother to go in.  They needed to scan the BuzzCard and I got
handouts.  Three are example résumés!  I should be able to coble
together a format from those (and look for good phrases).  Also, bring
plenty of water and lay off the monitor for a bit.  I'm sitting here a
bit light headed this afternoon.  It could be the heat or possibly the
light.

This guy works the career fair to ensure what he says accurate and
works.  He wrote the chapter in GT1000.

Crafting a resume for career.  *Keep to 1 page for career for fair*.
Dispense with one page once there is too much information.  The long
resume (up to 3 pages for grad student) is 

+   Name (bold)
+   address, email and phone number

Education
:   Georgia tech.  When will you graduate?  What are you a candidate in
    Do you have a minor?  What is concentration.  Can add security
    clearance.  Add certifications.
    
    GPA ≥3.2 always use it below, think about it.  If it is below 3.2,
    have a reason.  Can exclude as grad sudent.
    
    No high school.

    **Never** add relevant course work.  Integrate that into skills.
    
Skills
:   Comes next unless I have reserach or work experience in my field.

    Every course has 4 core ideas.  Those are the nouns that go in
    skills section.  Break the courses down to what they were about.
    Extract the concepts from each cource.

    No verbs and no qualifiers.  List things and go into deatails in
    reseach experience.  This is for keyword search.

    Istrumentation.  Every piece of equipment that I have worked with.

    The skill section shows the full package

    +   Communications: technical reports, presentations
    +   Leadership: member in off campus clubs, leadership in on campus
        clubs
    +   Spoken languages: List the languages (conversational, basic is
        allowed as qualifier)
    +   Athletic skills:
    +   Musical skills: Use them

Experience and projects
:   Includes work experience and class work.  Formatted the projects and
    experience

    What did I do where did it happen include title in group

    Include what tasks was.  Use bullets (1 line max).  Don't worry
    about full sentences.  Be concise.  *no paragraphs*.

    All work counts.  Remove only the excess once it's over 1 page.

    3 bullets per job.  Don't get carried away.

Activities and Honors
:   Throw away section.  This is where I can go on about anything.  Not
    nearly as important.  Conveys I'm more than a lab monkey.

This will give more than one page.  It is easy to trim down to one page
after the fact.

Font 11 or 12.  Keep it clean (Arial, Calibri). Adjust the margins as
necessary 10 is okay for long form.

Never put anything on a resume you have to explain.

Skills come before experience unless I have lots of experience

Objective is a little pointless.  The cover letter will do the work well
enough. 

Import information above the fold.

Use what you have because the competition will.

Go to career fair for information.  Go to network.  Have a nice little
introduction about myself.  Introduce myself, tell major, tell
concentration, tell what 

I do, tell what interested in, I'm available
to.  Give an idea who I am.  I'm able to, I'm available to, I'm capable
of, I am interested in .

Most likely, they'll say to apply online.  Cover letter puts the
facts in perspective.  There is another workshop.

Always keep in mind who the audience is.
