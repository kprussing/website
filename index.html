<h1 id="the-keith-page">The Keith Page</h1>
<p>Welcome to my web page! This is a brief introduction to me.</p>
<h2 id="activities-and-interests">Activities and interests</h2>
<p>I am a recovering professional sales man. I used to be a music major until I realized that would simply land me in the job I already had. Now I am a computational physicist. Most of my free time, I spend in the back yard with the wife and pups. The little one really likes fetch!</p>
<p>As for the stuff you really care about, my current fascinations revolve around computing. I am trying to teach myself the intricacies of proper parallel programing. That is slow going because I do not own a super-computer with which to practice. I am also intrigued by heat transfer. There is an open problem out there on how to couple the radiative exchange in the thermal bands to the conductive modes of energy exchange numerically. I got time as an undergrad to play with a finite difference approach to the problem; however, the program was limited by the fact that it was written in the 1980s. This means that the program has hard codded limits that are not trivial to modify. The method is based on computing the view factors known in computer graphics; however, this does not mesh well with the larger node scale necessary for the heat transfer. To account for the thermal shadow, we need to figure out a way to determine the power delivered to a surface when only a fraction of the surface participates in the exchange.</p>
<p>Coupled with my thesis work, I want to investigate methods of solving linear systems where the matrix is a block matrix. There has to be a systematic method to solve this type of system. Specifically, I have a situation where the matrix is comprised of 2 by 2 block elements that are symmetric up to a minus sign. There is symmetry in how the elements are computed that is not being exploited. This means that swapping the indexes of the block simply gets you the symmetric block of the matrix. Currently, I am using a brute force method to solve the system. I would love for the chance to search for a more efficient method to solve the system.</p>
<h2 id="my-work-at-gtri">My Work at GTRI</h2>
<p>Currently, I am investigating the effects of shape on near-field radiative transfer. We all know from undergraduate physics that all objects are surrounded by a thermally generated electromagnetic field. At large separations, this is simply the black-body exchange predicted by statistical mechanics. When the separation between the objects is small enough, the surface reach a point where they are within the decay range of the evanescent waves trapped on the surfaces. We want to establish a long range structure that can direct the energy through a system of particles. This would be useful for thermal control of low temperature experiments, micro and nano scaled structures, and it even applies to evolution of interstellar gasses if the literature can be believed. To do this, we need to understand what the effect of particle shape is.</p>
<p>Currently, we are developing a framework in Python to process hyper-spectral imagery. My task was to establish the framework and guide the development of the software to get out of the choke-hold of MATLAB. Long term goals include real time processing of hyper-spectral data for <em>in situ</em> checking during field work and processing spectral data to predict broad band sensor response. The end goal is to use any means necessary to enhance performance including acceleration with graphic processing units.</p>
<p>Studied electromagnetic wave scattering from non-spherical particles.</p>
<p>Studied the performance parameters of counter flow cooling towers to understand the energy emission under normal load.</p>
<p>I refined my vehicle dynamics model into a full rigid body model for untracked, four wheel land vehicles under normal conditions. The routine was implemented in MATLAB and hooked into a SQL database for simulation of complex urban environments.</p>
