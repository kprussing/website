<p>I am a recovering professional sales man. Oh, and I used to be a music major until I realized that would simply land me in the job I already had. Most of my free time, I spend in the back yard with the wife and pups. The little one really likes fetch!</p>
<p>As for the stuff you really care about, my current fascinations revolve around computing. I am trying to teach myself the intricacies of proper parallel programing. That is slow going because I do not own a super-computer with which to practice. I am also intrigued by heat transfer. There is an open problem out there on how to couple the radiative exchange in the thermal bands to the conductive modes of energy exchange numerically. I got time as an undergrad to play with a finite difference approach to the problem; however, the program was limited by the fact that it was written in the 1980s. This means that the program has hard codded limits that are not trivial to modify. The method is based on computing the view factors known in computer graphics; however, this does not mesh well with the larger node scale necessary for the heat transfer. In order to account for the thermal shadow, we need to figure out a way to determine the power delivered to a surface when only a fraction of the surface participates in the exchange.</p>
<p>Coupled with my thesis work, I want to investigate methods of solving linear systems where the matrix is a block matrix. There has to be a systematic method to solve this type of system. Specifically, I have a situation where the matrix is comprised of 2 by 2 block elements that are symmetric up to a minus sign. There is symmetry in how the elements are computed. This means that swapping the indexes of the block simply gets you the symmetric block of the matrix. Currently, I am using a brute force method to solve the system. I would love for the chance to search for a more efficient method to solve the system.</p>
