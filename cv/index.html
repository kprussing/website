<dt>2009-Present</dt>
<dd><p>Graduate Research Assistant at Georgia Tech Research Institute (Atlanta, GA).</p>
<p>Currently investigating the effects of shape on near-field radiative transfer. We all know from undergraduate physics that all objects are surrounded by a thermally generated electromagnetic field. At large separations, this is simply the black-body exchange predicted by statistical mechanics. When the separation between the objects is small enough, the surface reach a point where they are within the decay range of the evanescent waves traped on the surfaces. We want to establish a long range structure that can direct the energy through a system of particles this would be useful for thermal control of low temperature experiments, micro and nano scaled structures, and it even applies to evolution of interstellar gasses if the literature can be believed. To do this, we need to understand what the effect of particle shape is.</p>
<p>Currently developing a framework in Python to process hyper-spectral imagery. My task was to establish the framework and guide the development of the software to get out of the chokehold of MATLAB. Long term goals include real time processing of hyper-spectral data for <em>in situ</em> checking during field work and processing spectral data to predict broad band sensor response. The end result is to utilize any means necessary to enhance performance including acceleration with graphic processing units.</p>
<p>Studied electromagnetic wave scattering from nonspherical particles.</p>
<p>Studied the performance parameters of counter flow cooling towers to understand the energy emission under normal load.</p>
<p>I refined my vehicle dynamics model into a full rigid body model for untracked, four wheel land vehicles under normal conditions. The routine was implemented in MATLAB and hooked into a SQL database for simulation of complex urban environments.</p>
</dd>
<dt>2007-2009</dt>
<dd><p>Student Research Assistant at Georgia Tech Research Institute (Atlanta, GA).</p>
<p>Developed a rudimentary dynamic model for untrack vehicle motion to be incorporated into an urban environment simulation. The end goal was to develop a framework in which we could predict the signature of an urban environemt across the visible and infrared spectrum. I reimplemented a finite difference algorithm in C++ to hook into a SQL database to compute the temperature evolution of simple objects. I had a couple of weeks to study the lattice Boltzmann method in an attempt to couple the radiative and conductive modes of thermal energy transport.</p>

<dt>2007-2008</dt>
<dd><p>Sales Associate for Mori Luggage &amp; Gifts (Atlanta, GA).</p>
<p>General sales monkey. I helped increase sales, but I don't know by how much. I was not a manager, so I didn't really keep track. I basically applied all of my skills at sales to luggage to make a buck while I pursued my undergraduate degree.</p>
</dd>
<dt>2004-2007</dt>
<dd><p>Assistant Manager for Ken Stanton Music (Marietta, GA).</p>
<p>I was the assistant manager for the West Cobb store that regularly gave the flagship store a run for it's money on business. I was the top band and orchestra sales associate. So much so that I was pulled to the main store to make it look less bad. I worked closely with the network administrator to roll out a new point of sale system. I was basically quality assurance for him. I played buffer for the office staff, assistant manager, and basically everyone else to my department supervisor. I was offered fake degrees to not quit when I wanted to go back to school. I completed DiSC Sales Training, PMSA Relationshipe Selling Progra, and the Yamaha Certified Sales Professional training.</p>
</dd>
<dt>2002-2004</dt>
<dd><p>Stock Assistant for School Box (Tucker, GA).</p>
<p>Process shipment and restock shelves. I didn't say I got a better job. I still assisted customers with finding things. I was also tapped to go and set up new locations. I also spent a bit of time as a delivery boy.</p>
</dd>
<dt>2002-2002</dt>
<dd><p>Grill Operator for Waffle House (Norcross, GA).</p>
<p>Flipping burgers, cleaning the grill, and preparing the <em>mise en place</em> for the others while looking for a real job over the course of two months.</p>
</dd>
<dt>2000-2001</dt>
<dd><p>Sales Associate for Music &amp; Arts Center (Lawrenceville, GA).</p>
<p>General sales monkey. I was part of a team that increased sales by 20% over previous year. I helped customers by processing instrument rentals and returns, instrument and sheet music sales, and setting up music lessons.</p>
</dd>
<dt>1998-2000</dt>
<dd><p>Shift Supervisor at Panera Bread (Duluth, GA).</p>
<p>Well, if you really want <strong>everything</strong> this is included. Most generally efficient employee. Nominated for employee of the year twice. Associate trainer for store and local region.</p>

<h2 id="activities-and-interests">Activities and interests</h2>
<p>I am a recovering professional sales man. Oh, and I used to be a music major until I realized that would simply land me in the job I already had. Most of my free time, I spend in the back yard with the wife and pups. The little one really likes fetch!</p>
<p>As for the stuff you really care about, my current fascinations revolve around computing. I am trying to teach myself the intricacies of proper parallel programing. That is slow going because I do not own a super-computer with which to practice. I am also intrigued by heat transfer. There is an open problem out there on how to couple the radiative exchange in the thermal bands to the conductive modes of energy exchange numerically. I got time as an undergrad to play with a finite difference approach to the problem; however, the program was limited by the fact that it was written in the 1980s. This means that the program has hard codded limits that are not trivial to modify. The method is based on computing the view factors known in computer graphics; however, this does not mesh well with the larger node scale necessary for the heat transfer. In order to account for the thermal shadow, we need to figure out a way to determine the power delivered to a surface when only a fraction of the surface participates in the exchange.</p>
<p>Coupled with my thesis work, I want to investigate methods of solving linear systems where the matrix is a block matrix. There has to be a systematic method to solve this type of system. Specifically, I have a situation where the matrix is comprised of 2 by 2 block elements that are symmetric up to a minus sign. There is symmetry in how the elements are computed. This means that swapping the indexes of the block simply gets you the symmetric block of the matrix. Currently, I am using a brute force method to solve the system. I would love for the chance to search for a more efficient method to solve the system.</p>
