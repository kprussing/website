        <p>
        This is a collection of spell lists for Dungeons &amp Dragons
        3.5 edition.  The main goal is to have all of the available
        spells in a quick reference table.  This combines the spells I
        have from the books I have.  The inspiration for the tables
        comes from a Word document I found years ago.  I do not remember
        where I found it, and I can't find the documents again
        (although, I haven't really spent a lot of time looking).  The
        only thing I can claim credit for in the current incarnation is
        the brute force work that went into creating the tables.  The
        tables are generated using a script I wrote and in in my 
        <a href="http://github.com/kprussing/mysandbox">sandbox</a>.  If
        you want to help make the tables, let me know or just get
        cracking and send me a pull request.
