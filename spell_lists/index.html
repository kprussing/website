        This is a collection of spell lists for Dungeons &amp Dragons
        3.5 edition.  The main goal is to have all of the available
        spells in a quick reference table.  This combines the spells I
        have from the books I have.  The inspiration for the tables
        comes from a Word document I found years ago.  I do not remember
        where I found it, and I can't find the documents again
        (although, I haven't really spent a lot of time looking).  The
        only thing I can claim credit for in the current incarnation is
        the brute force work that went into creating the tables.  The
        tables were generated using a script I cobbled together to
        essentially run a preprocessor on input files.  You can take a
        look at in in my dotfiles on GitHub.
